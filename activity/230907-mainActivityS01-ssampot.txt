Hi, my name is Samantha Sampot.
I'm currently a Computer Science student at De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. I recently finished my OJT at Ollopa Corporation this week. I learned a lot from our supervisor, especially regarding discipline and professionalism. Hopefully, I'll be able to gain more experiences in the near future.
I recently got into a video game called League of Legends. I'm still learning a lot, but currently, my favorite characters from the game are Aphelios and Taric. I also do crochet and I've made a handful of project already. I gift most of them to my friends. As for music, I'm currently into K-pop. My favorite group is Ateez, and I'm about to go to their concert here in the Philippines next week.
