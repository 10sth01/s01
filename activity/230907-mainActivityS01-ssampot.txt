Hi, my name is Samantha Sampot.
I'm currently a Computer Science student at De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. I recently finished my OJT at Ollopa Corporation this week. I learned a lot from our supervisor, especially regarding discipline and professionalism. Hopefully, I'll be able to gain more experiences in the near future.
